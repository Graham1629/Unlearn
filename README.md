# Unlearn
Enter your high school graduation year and discover the "facts" you were taught that have since been proven wrong.

Remember when Pluto was a planet? When you were told you only use 10% of your brain? When the food pyramid said to eat 11 servings of bread a day?
UNLEARN is a simple website that reveals how much of your education has already expired. Just enter the year you graduated high school, and it generates a personalized list of “facts” you were confidently taught that have since been debunked, corrected, or completely overturned.
Covering biology, astronomy, history, health, psychology, and more, it is a humbling reminder that knowledge evolves, textbooks lag behind, and maybe we should all be a little less certain about the things we “know.”
